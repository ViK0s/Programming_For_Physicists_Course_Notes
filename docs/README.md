# ProgrammingForPhysicistsPython
A compilation of all programs made by me during my "programming for physicists" college course  

## Description

I have made the repository as a simple archive of all the work for the college course.
Unfortunately while most comments were made using english, some of the variables inside using polish for their names,
below you can find simple descriptions for all the programs, including screenshots of the exercises they were made for (again, they are written in polish.)

## Table of contents:
